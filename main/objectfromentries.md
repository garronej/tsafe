description: Like Object.fromEntries() but with a better return type

# 🌟 objectFromEntries

Functionally identical to `Object.fromEntries()` but instead of returning but its return type more precise than just `{ [k: sting]: any; }`.

```typescript
const entries = [
    ["a", "foo"],
    ["b", 33],
    ["c", true as boolean],
] as const;

const obj = objectFromEntries(entries);
//    ^ obj is of type { a: "foo"; b: 33; c: boolean; }

assert<
    Equals<
        typeof obj,
        {
            a: "foo";
            b: 33;
            c: boolean;
        }
    >
>();
```
