# id

Literally just:

```typescript
export const id = <T>(x: T) => x;
```

It directly returns the parameter it was given as input.

## Example 1: Simultaneously declaring a type and instantiating a default value for this type

```typescript
import { id } from "tsafe/id";

const defaultCat = {
	name: "Felix",
	gender: id<"male" | "female">("male"),
};

type Cat = typeof defaultCat;
```

![Cat["gender"] is "male" | "female"](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

If we don't use `id`, `Cat["gender"]` is of type `string`

![Cat["gender"] is string](<.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

We could have used `"male" as "male" | "female"`

```typescript
const defaultCat = {
	name: "Felix",
	gender: "male" as "male" | "female",
};

type Cat = typeof defaultCat;
```

But this is less type safe because we do not validate that the value that we gives to gender is actually assignable to "male" | "female".

This error for example slips through:

!["MALE" is all caps, which should be a typing error](<.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

## Example 2: Instantiating an object of type T

Let's say you have this function:

```typescript
declare function getArea(shape: Shape): number;
```

And let's say a shape object is defined as follows:

```typescript
type Circle = { type: "circle"; radius: number };
type Square = { type: "square"; sideLength: number };
type Shape = Circle | Square;
```

We want to instantiate a `Circle` and pass it to `getArea` we can do:

```typescript
const circle: Circle = { type: "circle", radius: 33 };
getArea(circle);
```

If we want to avoid declaring a variable, we can do

```typescript
getArea({ type: "circle", radius: 33 });
```

The problem, however, is that this `Circle` was not as easy to instantiate because TypeScript doesnâ€™t know what kind of shape we are trying to instantiate:

![Every possible properties are listed](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

id lets you declare that the shape you are instantiating is a `Circle`

```typescript
import { id } from "tsafe/id";

getArea(id<Circle>({ type: "circle", radius: 33 }));
```

![TypeScript knows we are instantiating a Circle](.gitbook/assets/image.png)
